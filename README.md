Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a software engineer bootcamp graduate from HyperionDev and currently
pursuing my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of South Africa (UNISA). 
As a passionate learner and aspiring developer and data scientist, I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects and continue
honing my skills in Python programming, Data science, SQL, SQLite, Django, Docker, and NLP. I'm actively seeking junior or
intern positions where I can apply my knowledge and gain practical experience in the field. Feel free to explore
my projects and reach out for collaborations or opportunities to work together. Let's innovate and create
something amazing together!
